# I-CARE
(Graduation Project)


The Smart Medical Diagnosis and Healthcare Application will empower patients to access intelligent medical diagnoses, book appointments, interact with doctors, and manage their healthcare needs seamlessly.
The application will leverage artificial intelligence models, data analysis, and user-friendly interfaces to deliver an exceptional user experience while ensuring privacy and security of patient information.

As a team leader, I have distributed the tasks on the team members, using Agile methodology so we communicate with others weekly for create a presentation for the work done.

I am responsible for the AI modules,
AI NLP chatbot + Computer Vision models that mimic a doctor

The project consists of 3 main modules:

- Module 1
An AI Natural Language Processing NLP based chatbot called "Caroline" talking to the patient and taking its disease symptoms, then diagnosing the disease and recommend making some tests as x-ray, MRI ... in addition, given information about the predicted disease as an overview, symptoms, and treatments.
it can predict 30 diseases.
examples: (Breast_Cancer, Influenza, Covid 19, Stroke, ...)

- Module 2
A sequence of 20 AI Computer Vision models for scanning medical imaging and tests it can scan (X-ray, MRI, CT, OCT, ECG, or Food image), detect the image type (Image Recognition), if it is medical imaging image, applying anatomical recognition, disease evaluation, disease diagnosis.
It can predict 25 disease types.
examples: (Bone Fracture, Brain Tumor, Covid 19, Breast Cancer, ...)

It also can recognize 101 food types from images and shows the approximate number of calories per gram.

There is also a ML model for Electrocardiogram ECG scan predicts the heart diseases.

- Module 3
A mobile and web applications (native).
Patients after applying the smart diagnosis, chatbot can orientate them to booking an appointment in a laboratory, clinic, or even to purchase the prescription medicines.

The patient can search for clinics, Laboratories, or pharmacies each have its page, and filter them according to the nearest, cheapest, or according to its health insurance.

The doctors, pharmacists, and laboratory specialists can create accounts on the website and schedule patients' appointments.

The application will notify the patient to remind him for a doctor appointment or for its medication dose.
